# ddc/vcp

A simple util for reading, writing VCP commands and reading capabilities string over the i2c bus. No checks, validations, databases or retries are done to keep it as quick as possible.

See the example folder for a couple examples for how to use this library and in the docs folder there is some information about the protocols and vcp codes.
